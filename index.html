			<p>Junior year is difficult, but it's not as stressful as it could be. I'm enjoying my English and Math class a lot this year, but History has been a bit difficult.</p>

			<p>One of my favorite books I've read is "The Secret History" by Donna Tartt. It's a book I've read more recently and it delves into the minds of an eccentric group of college students in the Northeast. To me, it seems like an exploration of people's minds.</p>
